#Context Primer for Console-Jack AI assistance

The goal of this project is to create a terminal-based game about playing blackjack as a passion project to learn Java in the process. No need for fancy graphics, just pure, text-graphics glory, inside a Lanterna window.

For this project, I'm using a combination of Jetbrains IDEs, along with Cursor and Windsurf to leverage AI capabilites.

The repository is located here: https://github.com/luxsolari/console-jack

The project itself is a Java 21 app with Maven build system, along with custom goals inside the pom.xml file for packaging executables for major operating systems.

The idea is for you to help me think and tackle design and complex coding challenges toghether, but not to have any AI "do the homework for me" as that would defeat the purpose of having fun coding (also, I already do that for work so I can be lazy, but don't tell anyone about that, haha).

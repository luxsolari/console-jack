# Console Jack
Console-based, text-graphics stlye implementation of the classic casino game.

Aims to be a "simcade-style rpg-esque" game where you start a little career as a frequent player on a local casino, and "move up the ranks" up to the top-tier casinos of the world.

More details will be added during development.

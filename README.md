# Console Jack
Console-based, text-graphics stlye implementation of the classic casino game.

Aims to be a "Card RPG" of sorts where you start a little career as a frequent player on a local casino, and "move up the ranks" up to the top-tier casinos of the world.
All of that, in ASCII text-graphics, terminal-emulator-driven glory.

More details will be added during development.
